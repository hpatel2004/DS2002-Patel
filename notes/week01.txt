What is GitHub? Why are we using it in this course?

GitHub is a centralized repository that allows for consistent updates to a codebase from multiple users. It supports local development and has the capability to handle merge conflicts from different versions of a file. We are using it in this course to show incremental development on our assignments, with short commit messages to summarize our work at each stage. We are also using GitHub for collaboration with our peers on the course projects, so as to have consistency across our work. 


What confused you about GitHub so far?

Nothing has truly confused me regarding GitHub within the scope of this course. However, in my CS classes involving lots of development, I have often found trouble related to using `git merge` versus `git rebase`, which has caused me a great deal of trouble in merging others' work while maintaining original credits and a linear history.
